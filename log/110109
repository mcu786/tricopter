14:10 Tried soldering a jumper wire to work around fried trace on Seeeduino: didn't work.
14:10 Then tried applying 12 V from ATX power supply to USB power lines: something started smoking, so I stopped.
14:10 Then tried applying 9 V from battery to C8 (optional capacitor pinholes): works.
14:10 Is there a resistor somewhere that limits the total current flow through the Seeeduino? Maybe the USB lines are ignored because USB max current is 500 mA anyway. I need schematics.
