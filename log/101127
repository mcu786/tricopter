02:04 arscons did not work as intended. Final compiled hex file was larger than the one compiled by the Arduino IDE, so I'm guessing the build process was different and incorrect.
02:04 Makefile downloaded from here: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1265576847
02:04 This one works! Need to manually reset and run 'make upload' at the same time. Automatic reset not working for now. Will take care of later.
02:28 Added an include option to CXXFLAGS in Makefile to include libraries in directories of choice.
