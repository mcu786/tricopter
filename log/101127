02:04 arscons did not work as intended. Final compiled hex file was larger than the one compiled by the Arduino IDE, so I'm guessing the build process was different and incorrect.
02:04 Makefile downloaded from here: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1265576847
02:04 This one works! Need to manually reset and run 'make upload' at the same time. Automatic reset not working for now. Will take care of later.
02:28 Added an include option to CXXFLAGS in Makefile to include libraries in directories of choice.
10:54 When I add Serial to the sketch code, the rest of the sketch will not work. It's a Linux problem? http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1276727004
11:14: Aha. Bug identified: http://andybrown.me.uk/ws/2010/10/24/the-major-global-constructor-bug-in-avr-gcc/
14:35 GCC Bugzilla report: http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44617
14:36 Rebuilding GCC 4.5.1 with patch: http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=21461&action=diff
14:51 Serial bug with atmega1280 (Mega) is not present with atmega328p (Duemilanove).
14:56 Patch works! Yes!
