02:42 Defined ARDUINO_LIBS in Makefile to include Arduino default libraries.
03:46 Code from http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1278367409/15 successfully reports gyro data but can only be compiled through the Arduino IDE. Commandline compilation has trouble referencing the Wire library.
04:11 Tried build script provided at http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1253788114, but it was written for Arduino 0017 and changing pathnames was not enough.
