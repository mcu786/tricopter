02:42 Interesting. If I send a header and only one value instead of the two the Seeeduino currently expects, the Seeeduino fills the second value with 0xFF. Or rather, the Arduino IDE might be sending 0xFF to the Seeeduino. I've no idea. In any case, that will interfere with my communication protocol.
