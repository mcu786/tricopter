101228 06:42 How do I change PWM resolution?
101228 06:52 SERHEAD should eventually be changed to HOVHEADER as opposed to ACROHEADER so the tricopter will automatically change flight modes and interpret commands according to header type.


Use external ADC? (Another uC?)
Try setting sampling rates of accelerometer and gyro to their maxima and see if read time decreases significantly.

Servo mount with arm on boom and motor on servo body? Reinforce servo at back.
Metal servo arm that won't strip.
